**utoronto-course-checker** can be used for continuously checking availability of courses from the University of Toronto timetable website and sending a notification to your device when there is a change in availability for the courses specified in *interested_courses.py*.

This is motivated by the first come first serve course registration system for the period after the waitlist closes.

[Set up](https://notify.run/) is required for notify-run on your device to receive notifications. Run *course_checker.py* after updating *interested_courses.py* and installing dependencies.
